#Steps to Run our Guided MCMC of Bayesian Models

#1 Make sure you have required files in input folder which is generated by preprocssing.py
#2 To run our model execute below command in cmd/terminal
	python start.py config_file_path K
Note:K represents no of events and if you want to run for different no of events you can do so by typing space then different K value
    :config_file_path should not contain space in between them.

config file variables meaning
alpha= dirichlet hyper-parameter
kappa= dirichlet hyper-parameter
lamb= hyper-parameter
nu=   hyper-parameter
mew=  hyper-parameter
delta= hyper-parameter
H= No. of image levels
savestep=10 --means for every 10 iteration it will save all parameters.
niters=100  --means no of iterations are 100.
which_iteration_start=1  --means if there is already a checkpoint, we can resume at which iteration it was ealier saved.
image_dataset_flag=keep it False for text data, otherwise True for image data.
checkpoint_load_flag --To load last checkpoint of all learned parameters, then use it as True. 
main_folder_directory --keep it false for first time, it will create an subfolder in the outputpath.
event_folder_flag --keep it False for first time, it will create an subsubfolder in the outputpath.
ksi_flag If sampling of ksi is not required then keep it True.
single_rare_event_flag --keep it True only if there are only two classes
multi_rare_event_flag --keep it true when we have multiple classes
all_1_for_nonrare_flag -- incase if you want to give 1 for all indexes set it to True.
res_path --give folder path of the required GMBM input.
output_folder --results of GMBM will be stored in this path.

[guidance]
no_guidance_flag -- set it True if guidance is not given for any index.
single_rare_event_index --means only one rare event we want to give guidance.
multi_rare_event_indexes --multiple rare events indexes we can give input ,and can be used as multi-class way format.
event_1=visual_word1,visual_word2 --guidance for each event/topic is given in this way first we have to write event_ then next will be index then next is = and finally the guidance separated by ,
